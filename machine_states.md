## Documentation
Please mainly refer to the main API documentation published by Miele
* [General Documentation](https://www.miele.com/developer/swagger-ui/index.html)

There are some data points available in 2 kinds. As a human-readable text and as a number.
These numeric data fields belonging to a text field have the same name, but a "_raw" appended.
Those fields which have a general meaning are listed below.
The fields which aren't listed vary in their meaning from device to device and are not documented by Miele.
If you need to refer in scripts to these fields, always use the _raw values.
The text values may change in the future and also depend on the language.
Here is a list of what these raw values stand for:
